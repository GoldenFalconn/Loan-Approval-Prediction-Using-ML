# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-ML



This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to assist in the loan approval process. Instead of manually verifying each application, the system predicts whether a candidateâ€™s profile is relevant for loan approval based on key features such as:

Marital Status

Education

Applicant Income

Credit History

Property Area

Loan Amount and Term

By automating this prediction, the model helps financial institutions save time, reduce human bias, and improve efficiency in decision-making.
